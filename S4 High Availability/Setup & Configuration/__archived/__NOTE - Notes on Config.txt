While the idea is to replace all of the stuff in this folder ... 

Just remember that: 
	- the stuff in this folder is ALL about CONFIGURATION - or getting AGs/Mirrored-DBs up and running/ready
		(i.e., creating the environment). 

	- some of the other sprocs that I'll have around management and setup/configuration will be MORE 
		geared at ... adding specific DBs to AGs/Mirroring and/or similar things.
