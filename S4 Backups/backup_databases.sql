

-- NEXT STEPS (with version 3.8.2.16655 modifications):
--		a) create-directory checks need to include the PATH as part of the error. 
--				in other words, I specified: X:\Pigs\ as the path to push @CopyTo backups to... and got this message: 
--					HResult 0x5620, Level 16, State 1 -> xp_create_subdir() returned error 3, 'The system cannot find the path specified.'
--			I want that to say: "Error when creating/validating path X:\Pigs\ACESvc. Error [ HResult 0x5620, Level 16, State 1 -> xp_create_subdir() returned error 3, 'The system cannot find the path specified.' ]
--		b) likewise, when I specified X:\Pigs as the path... file removal... (attempting to remove OLDER files from X:\pigs) threw errors - as in, ERRORS, or EXCEPTIONS (not warnings about file copy operations)
--			in the form of: 
--				Unexpected Error removing backups. Error: 50000 - Invalid @TargetDirectory specified - either the path does not exist, or SQL Server's Service Account does not have permissions to access the specified directory. 
--			I'd like that to:
--				1) specify @TargetDirectory VALUE - because a variable there doesn't help at ALL with debugging. 
--				2) somehow log this as a COPY detail - (which shouldn't be too hard) ... given that this is related to the COPY TO operation. 
--					or, in other words, failure to remove older backups from @BackupPath = Exception/Error. But failure to remove OLDER copies from the COPY TO Location is ... a network hiccup/warning instead. 
--							(and, after x attempts at trying to copy files - which will also mean cleanup attempts), we'll STOP working on these and... be done. 

--		c) start implementing and testing the retry logic (now that everything else is working as expected). 
--		d) test the hell out of this. 
--			AND, under these concerns, I have to ensure that WHEN I do a better job of makign each 'step' in the backup process (check paths, generate backup code, run backup code, verify backup, copy to secondary, delete backups, etc.)
--				that I DON'T create a nightmare scenario where (either locally or on the secondary) that I'm _DELETING_ files when the backup didn't WORK or get copied/etc. 
--					i.e., it's always better to 'run out of disk' (and get the alerts before hand) than to let 'cleanup code' somehow remove ALL backups in some 'nightmare' scenario where
--					backups aren't happening, but 'cleanup' does happen - over the period of hours/days... 
--						PRETTY sure I've got code that accounts for this scenario - just want to make sure I don't 'overwrite' that code/logic in making this routine more robust.


-- ALSO see the vNEXT notes down blow... in terms of 'retry' logic and DECOUPLING copy operations from backup operations. that stuff all needs to be tackled at the same time. 




/*

	DEPENDENCIES:
		- Requires dbo.backup_log (logging table to keep details about errors (and successful executions if @LogSuccessfulOutcomes = 1). 
		- Requires dbo.split_string - to parse results from dba_LoadDatabases.
		- Requires dbo.load_database_names - sproc used to 'parse' or determine which dbs to target based upon inputs.
		- Requires dbo.execute_uncatchable_command - sproc used to execute backup and other compands in order to be able to CAPTURE exception
			details and error details (due to bug/problem with TRY/CATCH in T-SQL). 
		- Requires that xp_cmdshell is ENABLED before execution can/will complete (but the sproc CAN be created without xp_cmdshell enabled).
		- Requires a configured Database Mail Profile + SQL Server Agent Operator. 

	NOTES:
		- There's a serious bug/problem with T-SQL and how it handles TRY/CATCH (or other error-handling) operations:
			https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/746979/try-catch-construct-catches-last-error-only
			This sproc gets around that limitation via the logic defined in dbo.dba_ExecuteAndFilterNonCatchableCommand;

		- A good way to simulate (er, well, create) errors and issues while executing backups is to:
			a) start executing a backup of, say, databaseN FROM a query/session in, say, databaseX (where databaseX is NOT the database you want to backup). 
			b) once the process (working in databaseX) is running, switch to another session/window and DROP databaseX WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE... 
			and you'll get a whole host of errors/problems. 

		- This sproc explicitly uses RAISERROR instead of THROW for 'backwards compat' down to SQL Server 2008.

	TODO:
		- test/validate (and clean-up) on case-sensitive server (as much as those suck).
		- Review and potentially integrate any details defined here: 
			http://vickyharp.com/2013/12/killing-sessions-with-external-wait-types/

		- Better Error Handling. 
			Right now... many of the operations that UPDATE a row in ... dba_BackupDatabases_Log... are NOT doing ErrorMessage = ErrorMessage + @ErrorMessage - meaning code is overwriting previous details... 

		- vNEXT: 
			In addition to the 'retry' logic stuff below... need to 'decouple' secondary/copy-to backups from this sproc. 
				specifically, implementation logic shouldn't be handled here... it should be handled in the \utilities\dba_SynchronizeBackups sproc... 
				AND this sproc will just attempt to CALL that... and handle errors/issues when that won't work... i..e, that'd be a situation where a) we retry, b) we warn that off-box backups/copies weren't able to run as expected... 

				then... in the core of dba_SynchronizeBackups the following would be done: 
					a) copy files from primary to secondary that aren't already there... 
					b) remove any files > @CopyToRetention... 
					
					I BELIEVE the logic there should be fairly tricksy/hard... 
					 vs what i'm doing now - which is 'hard coupled' logic (local backup and then COPY - or the operation FAILS).... 
					
					BUT, i think i could probably do something where... i added a new column to dba_BackupLogs... that would keep tabs of any files that hadn't been copied over? or maybe a whole new table? 
						so that once 'connectivity' is back up... we just copy any files that need to be copied... and something lilke that... right? 
						 

		- Add in simplified 'retry' logic for both backups and copy-to operations (i.e., something along the lines of adding a column to the 'list' of 
			dbs being backed up and if there's a failure... just add a counter/increment-counter for number of failures into @targetDatabases along
			with some meta-data about what the failure was (i.e., if we can't copy a file, don't re-backup the entire db) and then drop this into the 
			'bottom' of @targetDatabases... and when done with other dbs... retry  up to N times on/against certain types of operations. 
				that'll make things a wee bit more resilient (and, arguably... should throw in a WAITFOR DELAY once we start 'reprocessing') without
				hitting a point where a failed backup and/or copy operation could, say, retry 10x times with 30 seconds lag between each try because... 
					ALLOWING that much 'retry' typically means there's a huge problem and... we're hurting ourselves rather than failing and reporting 
					the error. I could/should also keep tabs on the AMOUNT of time spent ... and log it into a 'notes' column in .. dbo.backup_log.

		- vNEXT: Additional integration with AGs (simple 2-node AGs first via preferred replica UDF), then on to multi-node configurations. 
			And, in the process, figure out how to address DIFFs as... they're not supported on secondaries: 
				http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/152622/differential-backups-are-not-supported-on-secondary-replicas

		- vNEXT: Potentially look at an @NumberOfFiles option - for striping backups across multiple files
			Note that this would also require changes to dbo.dba_RestoreDatabases (i.e., to allow multiple files per 'logical' file) and
			there aren't THAT many benefits (in most cases) to having multiple files (though I have seen some perf benefits in the past on SOME systems)

--			need to add some additional logic/processing here. 
--			a) look for failed copy operations up to X hours ago? 
--		    b) try to re-run them - via dba_sync... or ... via 'raw' roboopy? hmmm. 
--			c) mark any that succeed as done... success. 
--			d) up-tick any that still failed. 
--			e) for any that exceed @maxCopyToRetries - create an error and log it against all previous rows/databases that have failed? hmmm. Yeah... if we've been failing for, say, 45 minutes and sending 'warnings'... then we want to 
--				'call it' for all of the ones that have failed up to this point... and flag them as 'errored out' (might require a new column in the table). OR... maybe it works by me putting something like the following into error details
--				(for ALL rows that have failed up to this point - i.e., previous attempts + the current attempt/iteration):
--				"Attempts to copy backups from @sourcePath to @copyToPath consistently failed from @backupEndTime to @now (duration?) over @MaxSomethingAttempts. No longer attempting to synchronize files - meaning that backups are in jeopardy. Please
--					fix @CopyToPath and, when complete, run dba_syncDbs with such and such arguments? to ensure dbs copied on to secondary...."
--			   because, if that happens... then... the 'history' for backups will show errors (whereas they didn't show/report errors previously - so that covers 'history' - with a summary of when we 'called it'... 
--				and, this covers... the current rows as well. i.e., they'll have errors... which will then get picked up by the logic below. 
--			f) for any true 'errors', those get picked up below. 
--			g) for any non-errors - but failures to copy, there needs to be a 'warning' email sent - with a summary (list) of each db that hasn't copied - current number of attempts, how long it's been, etc.
