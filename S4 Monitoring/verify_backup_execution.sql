/*

	TODO:


	vNEXT:
		- Add functionality for @DiffBackupAlertThresholdMinutes ... to optionally specify DIFF backup frequencies. 
				This isn't really needed for all dbs... and ... in some cases it'll mean setting up a job/execution that checks all DBs except 'bigdatabase' + another execution for 'big-database' that checks full/diff/t-log on different thresholds than 'other' databases.

		- There's a common enough scenario where... say, a larger DB will get 'hammered' once or twice a week with a data-load or other type of LARGE (write-heavy) operation such that the t-log backup at that point will ROUTINELY
			go 'long' compared to what execution has been over the last N executions. Which means this'll raise an alert about a long-running t-log backup that IS sort of a concern/issue - but it's NOT really that OUT of sorts. 
				ideally... there'd be a way to account for that. Like, say, specifying a time-window when we could go 2x or even 6x on the duration... but, that's insanely hard to specify and 'parse' and the likes. 
				Or, another option would be ... IF we find the t-log running long, see if it's long/out-of-sorts with the same execution 1 day ago, and/or 1 week ago, and, frankly, even 1 month ago. 
						ASSUMING these are EASY queries to add into the mix... then this'd be the best option. 


		- I'm 'throwing' master and msdb into the 'mix' of dbs to check - period. 
				but... do i want to have those 'tied' to the same FULL backup thresholds? Seems like... NOT. 

				YEAH. Probably not. 
				In fact, guessing that I need an @SystemDBsFullBackupThresholdHours switch as well... and just default it to 24.... 


	Purpose/Goal
		- Can't have a backup job 'stuck' and just 'trying' but not failing. 
		- Also, don't want to have gone X time without T-Log backups being taken and such.
