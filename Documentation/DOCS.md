# APIs - Detailed S4 Documentation

NOTE: Before reading the documentation below, you should have a good handle on installation/setup, features and benefits, and S4 conventions. (The data in this section of the documentation is intended as reference material - whereas the documentation sections just mentioned focus primarily on how (and why) to get started with S4.)


## S4 Documentation
* [Setup and Installation](/Repository/Blob/00aeb933-08e0-466e-a815-db20aa979639?encodedName=feature~2f5.6&encodedPath=Documentation%2FSETUP.md)

* [Examples (Features and Benefits)](/Repository/Blob/00aeb933-08e0-466e-a815-db20aa979639?encodedName=feature~2f5.6&encodedPath=Documentation%2FFEATURES.md)
* [Using S4 (Conventions and Best Practices)s](/Repository/Blob/00aeb933-08e0-466e-a815-db20aa979639?encodedName=feature~2f5.6&encodedPath=Documentation%2FCONVENTIONS.md)
* **APIs (Detailed Documentation)**

## Version and Feature Support
[NOTE TO SELF: for each 'feature'/feature-page, i should use emojis to cover what's... covered
For example in the section on Audits, I'd have something like: 
* :warning: Requires Advanced S4 Error Handling (auditing probably doesn't... but this is a template..)
* :heavy_multiplication_x: SQL  Server on Linux
* :heavy_multiplication_x: SQL Server 2008 / 2008 R2 
* :heavy_check_mark: SQL Server on Windows
* :heavy_check_mark: SQL Server 2012
* :heavy_check_mark: SQL Server 2012

]

[And, with the info above, i then don't have to document as much of what is covered vs non-covered HERE in this section of the docs. INstead, i provide a high-level overview that says: "most stuff works on WIndows and 2008+ but these things (x, y, z) don't work on 2008/R2 and these things (a, b, c) won't work on Linux"]

NOTE: azure... meh... eventually, i need to treat Azure as 'just another platform' (and make it clear in these docs that 'Azure' means DB as a service - not SQL Server installed on Azure VMs)

NOTE: case-sensitive servers suck.. S4 isn't there yet.
