[NOTE TO SELF: this'll just be a ... 'TOC' page ... as in, it'll have: a) a brief overview of why best practices are important... then... it'll b) have a link to each of the various best-practices that I've defined so far (jobs creation(not created yet - but reallllllly needed), BACKUPS, RESTORES, TDE, AUDITS, etc... )]

[NOTE TO SELF: In addition to all best-practices docs/details that I've also defined, I need a 'Worst Practices' page - or a "Don't do this page" - similar to the following: 
https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This

[NOTE TO SELF: I need to drop in some detailed (i.e., best practices) info on how to create SQL Server Agent Jobs. Specifically: why (to automate stuff) - and why S4 uses them (because they;re powerful and solid), how (owners, naming, categories, scheduling, steps and handling... (and advanced options/recommendations) and ... ALERTS/NOTIFICATIONS...  and so on. ARGUABLY, I _MIGHT_ want to document the absolute hell out of agent jobs on definitivesql.com ... ]
